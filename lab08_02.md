# No TODOs
As we get further along, it's time to take a more independent role in these projects.\
For the last 2 prepared labs, there won't be any more **TODO** comments in pre-prepared scripts.\
From this point forward, you will be creating your own scripts.\
\
![Start](images/lab09/start.jpg "Start")

# The Character
I grabbed a package from the asset store [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/rpg-tiny-hero-duo-pbr-225148).\
You can see that in "Assets/RPG Tiny Hero Duo".\
That's the character you see with the sword, shield, and spikey hair.

## Animations
The character came with animations, and we'll be using the ones in this folder:\
"Assets/RPG Tiny Hero Duo/Animation/SwordAndShield".\
The package comes with both *root-motion* and *in-place* versions.\
We will use the *in-place* versions.

# The Scene
I re-used some of the same assets from the previous lab to create a little scene.\
The trees and rocks come from the asset store [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/low-poly-city-from-viuletti-132536).\
If you look at the prefabs like this one, "Assets/Viuletti City low poly/Prefabs/Nature/Birch small.prefab", you will notice that I've added collisions to these.

# Virtual Joysticks
We're going to use virtual thumbsticks in this project.\
I've downloaded a package for that from [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/joystick-pack-107631).\
You can find it under "Assets/Joystick Pack".
We'll get to that in part 5.
