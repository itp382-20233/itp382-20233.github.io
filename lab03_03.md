# Bomb
In the "Prefabs" folder, you will find "Bomb.prefab".\
If you look at it, you'll see it has a few components on it including a `SpriteRenderer` with this image on it:\
![Bomb](images/lab03/Laser_Start_100010002.png "Bomb")\
You might also notice it has a `LineRenderer`, a `Bomb` script, and a `CircleCollider2D`.

{: .note}
We will be talking about Colliders and Collision Detection next week.\
For this week, I have set it up for you.\
I don't have plans to specifically cover `LineRenderer` in class, but they are often useful.\
I suggest you use this as an example to refer to when you need to learn about them.

{: .todo}
* In the Game Scene, find the `GameObject` named "FireControl"
* That object has a `FireControl` script on it
* Drag your "Bomb" *prefab* into the "Bomb" slot of `FireControl`
	* If you look in the code, you'll see that is the variable `m_bomb`
	* Unity automatically converts "m_bomb" into "Bomb" for a more designer-friendly display
* Save the Scene

# Targeting Crosshair
In the "Sprites" folder, you will find Missile_Crosshairs.png.\
![Crosshair](images/lab03/Missile_Crosshairs.png "Crosshair")

{: .todo}
* Drag that into the scene to create a `GameObject` with a `SpriteRenderer` on it
* Drag that new `GameObject` into the "Prefabs" folder to create a *prefab*

{: .note}
For more information about *prefabs*, check out this supplementary video: [Prefabs](https://youtu.be/bOIAkIdOc6o)

{: .todo}
* Delete the `GameObject` "Missile_Crosshairs" from your scene
	* We don't want a crosshair in the scene to start off. This will be created as needed when the user touches the screen.
* Your "FireControl" object has a slot on it for "Cross Hair". Drag your new prefab into this slot
	* If you look in the code, you'll see that is the variable `m_crossHair`
	* Unity automatically converts "m_crossHair" into "Cross Hair" for display
* Save your scene

{: .warn}
It's not a bad idea to commit (and maybe even push) your project.\
We haven't done much, but it's wise to commit small changes at a time.\
You will need to add your new *prefab* and the *meta* file that goes with it.

# Explosions
## Create a new prefab for the missile explosion

{: .todo}
* Drag the Sprite "Sprites\Explosion\Sprites\Explotion0008.png" into the scene to create a `GameObject` with a `SpriteRenderer` on it
![Explosion](images/lab03/Explotion0008.png "Explosion")
* Rename the `GameObject` "Explosion"
* Add the script `MissileExplosion` to it
* Drag your new `GameObject` "Explosion" into the "Prefabs" folder to create a *prefab*
* Delete the `GameObject` from your scene

## Create a new prefab for the bomb explosion

{: .todo}
* Make a *prefab* called "BombExplosion" using Sprite "Sprites\BombExplosion\Sprites\Explotion0009.png"
![Bomb Explosion](images/lab03/Explotion0009.png "Bomb Explosion")
	* Open the "Bomb" `prefab`
	* The `Bomb` class has a field on it called `m_explosion`. Fill that in with your "BombExplosion" *prefab*

## Create a new prefab for the city explosion

{: .todo}
* Make a *prefab* called "CityExplosion" using Sprite "Sprites\CityExplosion\Flame0009.png"
![City Explosion](images/lab03/Flame0009.png "City Explosion")

# Missile
Create a new prefab for the Sprite "Sprites\Missile_small\Missile.png".\
![Missile](images/lab03/Missile.png "Missile")

{: .todo}
* Drag that into the scene to create a `GameObject` with a `SpriteRenderer` on it
* Add the script `Missile` to it
* The `Missile` script has a field `m_explosion`. Fill that in with your *prefab* "Explosion"
* Drag your new `GameObject` "Missile" into the "Prefabs" folder to create a *prefab*
* Delete the `GameObject` from your scene
* Your "FireControl" object has a slot on it for "Missile". Drag your new prefab into this slot
* Save your scene

# City
![City](images/lab03/CityA.png "City")

{: .warn}
Programmer art detected

{: .todo}
* Drag Sprite "Sprites/City/CityA.png" into the scene to create a `GameObject` with a `SpriteRenderer` on it
* Name it "City"
* Add the script `City` to it
* `City` has a slot `m_explosion` on it. Put *prefab* "CityExplosion" in there
* Drag that new "City" `GameObject` into the "Prefabs" folder to create a *prefab*
* Delete the `GameObject` from your scene
* Your "FireControl" object has a slot on it for "City". Drag your new prefab into this slot
* Save your scene

{: .test}
Play in Editor.\
The bombs come down leaving their trails behind.\
When they hit the cities, the "CityExplosion" sprite appears.\
![Test It](images/lab03/gameplay01.jpg "Test It")
We don't have any input control yet, so there's nothing you can do about it.

{: .warn}
It's definitely time to commit and push.
