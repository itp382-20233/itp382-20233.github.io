# PickupSpawner.cs
```
public class PickupSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject m_pickup;
    public int m_numPickup = 1;
    public float m_spacing = 2.0f;

    // Start is called before the first frame update

            {   // TODO Convert this Instantiate() to Allocate from a SpawnPool
                newObj = Instantiate(m_pickup);

    }
}
```

{: .todo}
* Convert the `Instantiate()` to `Allocate()` from an **ObjectPool**
* You can get the **ObjectPool** using `SpawnPools.Get().m_pickupPool`

{: .test}
If you Play in Editor, you should be able to see the bananas coming out from under "SpawnPools/PickupPool" and returning again.

# Pickup.cs
There is a **TODO** in `OnTriggerEnter()`
```
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (null != other.GetComponent<Player>())
        {
            {   // TODO use the "m_pickupEffect" inside SpawnPools to create an effect
                // put it at the same position as this object
            }
            Free();
        }
    }
```

{: .todo}
* Use the `m_pickupEffect` inside `SpawnPools.Get()` to create an effect
* Put it at the same position as this object

{: .test}
You should see the green splash and hear a pop sound when you pick up a banana
