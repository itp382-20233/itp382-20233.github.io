We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
Let's try to connect the motion of the finger trace more closely to the animation on screen.\
I've set up 2 animations files for this purpose.\
"Assets/Character/WindUp.fbx"\
"Assets/Character/Cast.fbx"

{: .todo}
* While the player is tracing the line, play the "WindUp" animation
* On a successful trace, transition to the "Cast" animation
* On a failed trace, just return to "Idle"
* While the player is tracing the line, set the animation timing to match the player's position along the line
	* If you trace along the line fast, the animation plays fast
	* If you trace slow, the animation advances slowly
	* At this point, you will even be able to scrub back and forth on the animation
* Make it so that you can only scrub forward and not backwards
* Finally set up limits for the minimum and maximum speed to successful tracing

# Design
Let the player choose which spell to cast.\
We already set up 3 animations, and there are several other animations in the folder if you want to try something else.

{: .todo}
* Create unique paths for each spell cast option
	* Try to make them somehow related to the spell animation
* Give the user some way to choose which spell to cast
	* Icons/Buttons?
	* Text Menu?
	* Show all 3 paths and let them trace whichever one they choose?
	* You decide and set it up
* Based on whichever spell they choose, play (or don't) the correct animation.

# Art
Replace the character and animations.

{: .todo}
* I got this character and the animations from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)
	* Feel free to use that to choose a different character and different animations
* Alternatively, use your own character and/or your own animations
