# Game Scene
Most everything interesting is part of the UI, so it's all under the "Canvas" object.

## Pause Menu
I've prepared a simple pause menu here. We don't really need it for anything.

## Grid
The bulk of the game all falls under the object called "Grid".\
It's got a rectangular image on it to represent the game board.\
You'll also see a **GemGrid** component. Let's go look at that.

# GemGrid.cs
## Public Variables
```
public class GemGrid : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject[] m_gemPrefab;
    public int m_width = 6;
    public int m_height = 6;
    public float m_gridSize = 50.0f;
    public GameObject m_gemPopSound;
    public GameObject m_pauseMenu;
```
`m_gemPrefab` is an array of prefabs for the "gems". They are actually fruits with faces on them.\
`m_width` and `m_height` describe the size of the grid. The default is a 6x6 grid of 36 "gems".\
`m_gridSize` is the spacing between cells in the grid... the space between "gems".\
`m_gemPopSound` is a **GameObject** which may seem weird for a sound. We're using a prefab with an **AudioSource** on it.
We do that to leverage the randomization features we built into **SimpleAnim** in the previous lab.\
`m_pauseMenu` is the pause menu.

## Private Variables
```
    Gem[,] m_grid;
    float[] m_yOffset;
    bool m_isAnimating = true;
    bool m_isPaused = false;
```
When the game begins, we fill in the grid with **Gem**s and save them in the 2D array `m_grid`.\
These gems come in from the top and fall down to settle in the grid.\
`y_Offset` is used to keep track of that spawn-in point above the grid.

## Start()
```
    void Start()
    {
        m_grid = new Gem[m_width, m_height];
        m_yOffset = new float[m_width];
        SetPause(false);
        FillGrid();
    }
```
The `Start()` function just initializes the variables and calls `FillGrid()` to spawn in the gems.\
This is mostly relevant for the Designer task at the end where the width and height may be allowed to vary.

## Update()
```
void Update()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < m_width; ++i)
        {
            m_yOffset[i] = 0.0f;
        }
        // wait for the falling to stop
        bool falling = false;
        for (int y = 0; y < m_height; ++y)
        {
            for (int x = 0; x < m_width; ++x)
            {
                if (null != m_grid[x, y] && m_grid[x, y].IsFalling())
                {
                    falling = true;
                    m_isAnimating = true;
                }
            }
        }

        if (false == falling)
        {
            if (false == CheckMatch())
            {
                m_isAnimating = false;
            }
        }

        // keys
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape))
        {   // this doubles as the option key in the android navigation bar
            SetPause(!m_isPaused);
        }
    }
```
Here we go through the grid and check whether the gems are settled yet or not.\
While the gems are falling, we mark `m_isAnimating` as `true`.\
Once the gems are all settled, we call `CheckMatch()`.

## CheckMatch()
```
    bool CheckMatch()
    {
        // a list of gems to be broken
        List<Gem> breakGems = new List<Gem>();

        {   // TODO
            // check for matches of 3 or more gems in the vertical direction
            // check for matches of 3 or more gems in the horizontal direction
        }

        {   // TODO call BreakGem() on all the gems in your list of gems to break
            // If there are any, play the gem popping sound
            // If any gems broke, return true to indicate we need to re-enter the "falling" stage
        }

        return false;   // returning false indicates everything is static
    }
```
This is where we're going to do most of our work.\
For now, it's mostly empty.

## The Rest
I've set up a lot of other helper functions like:\
`void SpawnGem(int x, int y)`\
`void FillGrid()`\
`public void BreakGem(int x, int y)`
`public void Swap(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)`

# Gem.cs
Most of the **Gem** class is set up for you.\
It has falling behavior, animations, and breaking capabilities.\
What we need to fill in will be the user-interaction parts.
```
public class Gem : MonoBehaviour
    // TODO Add pointer down and pointer up handlers
    // TODO add drag handlers
{
    public int m_gemType;
    public GameObject m_popAnim;
    public float m_gravity = 10.0f;
    public float m_maxSpeed = 100.0f;

    ...

    // TODO OnPointerDown
    // If the grid is animating, don't do anything
    // If the grid is still, set the bool "Touched" on the animator to true

    // TODO OnPointerUp
    // Set the "Touched" on the animator to false

    // TODO OnBeginDrag
    // Set m_isDragging true
    // Reset m_dragDelta to zero

    // TODO OnDrag
    // accumulate m_dragDelta
    // if m_dragDelta accumulates more than s_swipeDist in any single direction,
    // call m_grid.Swap()

    // TODO OnEndDrag
    // Set m_isDragging to false
    // Set the "Touched" bool on the animator to false
}
```
