# TraceIt.cs
We've got quite a lot to do in this class.

# Start()

{: .todo}
* In the first **TODO**
    * Use `GetComponent<>()` to find the **PathCreator** and save that as `m_path`
    * Use `GetComponent<>()` to find the **LineRenderer** and save that as `m_line`
* In the second **TODO**
    * Make the **LineRenderer** (`m_line`) have the same number of points as **PathCreator** (`m_path.path.NumPoints`)
    * Copy the position of each point from `m_path` into `m_line` (use `m_path.path.GetPoint()`)

{: .test}
Play In Editor.\
You should see a nice outline of the path to trace.

# Make a Copy of the LineRenderer

{: .todo}
* Find the third **TODO** in `Start()`
* Make a new object as a child of the "Spline" object (this **GameObject**)
    * Call your new **GameObject** "trace"
* Add a **LineRenderer** component to your new **GameObject**
    * Save the new **LineRenderer** in the member variable `m_traceLine`
* Set the `material` for your new **LineRenderer** to `m_traceMaterial`
* Copy all the positions for the new **LineRenderer** from `m_line` only moved forward by 0.01f units (negative z)

{: .test}
Play In Editor.\
The glowy overlay is what we're going to use to indicate successful finger tracing.
![Trace](images/lab06/trace1.jpg "Trace")

# Control the Line Width
The glowy bit is supposed to show where we've traced, and maybe how well we've done with that.\
But for now, it's just a giant blob.\
The plan is to adjust the width of the **LineRenderer** at each point so the line fills in where we've traced.

## Create the trace
Find the fourth **TODO** in `TraceIt.Start()`
```
        {   // TODO create an array of Keyframe - one for each point (m_path.path.NumPoints)
            // Fill each one with time going from 0.0f to 1.0f and value 0.0f for all
            // Set m_traceLine.widthCurve to a new AnimationCurve based on m_traceFrames
        }
```

{: .todo}
* Set `m_traceFrames to a new array of **Keyframe**s
    * one for each point (m_path.path.NumPoints)
* Fill each one with time going from 0.0f to 1.0f
    * the first one has a time of 0.0f
    * each one after that has a larger value
    * until the last **Keyframe** has a time value of 1.0f
* And set each one's value to the same as the time
* Set `m_traceLine.widthCurve` to a new **AnimationCurve** based on `m_traceFrames`

{: .test}
If you've set it up right, it should now look like this with the glowy line starting out thin and reaching maximum thickness at the end.
![Animation Curve](images/lab06/animationcurve.jpg "Animation Curve")
Notice that you can inspect the width of the **LineRenderer** and see the curve you created.

{: .warn}
Now's a good time to commit and push... just in case.
