# Looks Familiar
This project should look a lot like Lab08.\
We are using the same building assets from [Low poly city from Viuletti](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/low-poly-city-from-viuletti-132536#description)\
You can find them here: "Assets/Viuletti City low poly".\
In Lab08 we designed our own cities, but this time, I've simplified all of that, and we'll just start with this one I set up in the scene.

{: .note}
You can imagine how in a real game, we could combine the features from both projects.\
Players could build their own city, and share the file with other players.\
You could try to attack the city that another player designed.

# Character
We are also re-using the character we had from Lab09.\
I've included the assets from [RPG Tiny Hero Duo PBR](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/rpg-tiny-hero-duo-pbr-225148#reviews).\
You can find them here: "Assets/RPG Tiny Hero Duo".\
You'll need to pull in your **Character** class from the last lab as well as the **Animator** you created.

# Playfield.cs
I have set up a **Playfield** class for you once again.\
This time, I've stripped most of the functionality out of it. We won't be placing buildings this time, so I removed all that code.\
All that is left is the creation of the grass field at the start of the scene.\
You'll be adding some code in here later, but I have not left any **TODO** comments in the code.

# Destructable.cs
The **Destructable** class isn't particularly interesting, so I have simply provided it ready to go.\
All it really does is provide some hit points and a way to destroy something when the hit points run out.\
I have already attached a **Destructable** component to each of the buildings and trees in "Assets/Prefabs".

# Prefabs
We will be creating new components and adding them to the various prefabs in the scene.\
There are prefabs for the buildings, the trees, and the character.\
These are all under the folder "Assets/Prefabs".
